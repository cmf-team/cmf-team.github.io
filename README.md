## What is CMF

CMF is a community learning program focused on quantative finance, risk management and data analysis.
Orginally started as econometrics seminar in 2007 by Evgeniy Lukash and Andrey Zlotnik. 
Center for Mathematic Finance (CMF) was launched in 2012 as a free acess open education initiative. 

Each year we select students who would like to work on real-life quantative project and 
gain insights form mentors, peers and CMF alumni about banking, finance, economic research 
and new areas such as digital assets and fintech. Admission to program is free to students upon passing quantative exam.

## Why Github?

In CMF we believe in open science and collaborative work. Our original course is administered 
as videos and Jupyter notebooks in Google drive with chat in Slack and Moodle LMS. Works well,
but we think some parts of our work can be an open website or code repos.
