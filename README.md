# CMF Team Website

This repo hosts an experimental website for CMF Team.

The site is build with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) 
using remote [Primer](https://pages-themes.github.io/primer/) theme 
and hosted on Github Pages.

Site configuration: [\_config.yml](_config.yml).

Content: so far the website is just one page, built using [index.md](index.md). 

The site is hosted at <epogrebnyak.github.io/cmf-team>, but can move to a new own address.
