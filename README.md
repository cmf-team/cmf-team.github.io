## What is CMF

CMF is a community learning program focused on quantative finance, data analysis project and smart contracts.
Orginally started as econometrics seminar in 2007, launched as Center for Mathematic Finance (CMF) in 2012, 
it is now managed by program alumni as well as program founders, Andrey Zlotnik and Evgeniy Lukash. 

The program allows students to work on real life quantative projects in remote teams and gain insights 
from recent graduates about banking, trading, economic research and new areas in finance such 
as digital assets and fintech. Admission to program is free upon passing quantative exam.

## Why Github?

In CMF we believe in open science and collaborative work. Our original course is administered 
as videos and Jupyter notebooks in Google drive with chat in Slack and Moodle LMS. Works well,
but we think some parts of our work can be an open website or code repos.

## Our user: Jane Wu story

Should we provide entry-level or state-of-art for machine learning in finance code in a repo?
Should we give just project ideas or complete solutions as well? 
Would our enthusiasm for open code in finance sustain or dry out? 
How do our learning materials compare to other offerings?

We cannot answer this without experimenting and directing these experiments to a specific user.
In our initial discussion we thought the user is a professional who has to go over a entry barrier
in data analysis - starting to code and delivering projects that are meaningful for business.
The person is English-speaking, and perhaps of origin from an emerging market. This is a young woman 
in her twenties and her name is Jane Wu.

Our next step:

1. What would Jane Wu want to do in her career?
2. How do our Python notebooks help her?
3. Alternative characters, their intents and why this repo would help.
