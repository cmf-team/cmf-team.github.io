## What is CMF

CMF is a community learning program focused on quantative finance, data analysis project and smart contracts.
Orginally started as econometrics seminar in 2007, launched as Center for Mathematic Finance (CMF) in 2012, 
it is now managed by program alumni as well as program founders, Andrey Zlotnik and Evgeniy Lukash. 

The program allows students to work on real life quantative projects in remote teams and gain insights 
from recent graduates about banking, trading, economic research and new areas in finance such 
as digital assets and fintech. Admission to program is free upon passing quantative exam.

## Why Github?

In CMF we believe in open science and collaborative work. Our original course is administered 
as videos and Jupyter notebooks in Google drive with chat in Slack and Moodle LMS. Works well,
but we think some parts of our work can be an open website or code repos.
