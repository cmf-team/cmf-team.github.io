## Milestones

- Originally started as financial econometrics seminar in 2007 by Evgeniy Lukash and Andrey Zlotnik.
- Launched in 2012 as a free course focused on CFA preparation.
- Fully online, project-based and open to global enrollment since 2020.

## Our program

Each year we select students who would like to work on real-life quantitative projects and
gain insights from mentors, peers and CMF alumni covering topics in banking, finance, trading, economic research and frontier areas such as digital assets and fintech.

## Is the CMF program really free for students?

The cost of joining the CMF program is just your time and commitment. There are no tuition fees or other costs for students. All you have to do is to pass an entry exam and actively engage in projects you selected based on your interests.

## Is the CMF program worth it?

Totally. Our students are able to start or switch careers in banking and quantitative finance in reputable international companies and gain access to a network of alumni and peers.

## Why Github?

In CMF we believe in open science and collaborative work. Our original course is administered as videos and Jupyter notebooks in Google drive with chat in Slack and Moodle LMS. Works well, but we think some parts of our work can be open sourced.

[This repo](https://github.com/epogrebnyak/cmf-team) is an experimental home for code, datasets and videos by CMF.
